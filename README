Synopsis
We are a programming team working for Bicycle Parts Distributorship. 
BPD has a warehouse full of bicycle parts. 
The code and underlying data structures from Projects 1 and 2 apply to Project 3, but we will have to modify them. 
In this increment of the project BPD has identified several users of the software.  
There is a system administrator who creates, removes, and manages accounts. Additionally, can reset password.
There is an office manager who is responsible for many business aspects, such as examining parts, restocking parts, and using invoice to generate a sales commission. 
There is a warehouse manager who updates the warehouse inventory.
There is one sales associate in each sales van who sells bike parts to customers and creates an sales invoice.
In our program, these employees (system administrator, office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associates) have accounts that allow them to perform actions that are specific to their duties. 
The duties that each type of employee performs are described in various use case scenarios. 

What does the project do?
The intent for our program for project 3 was to create a software program for clients that are bike part distributorship companies looking for a software program for their employees.
Our program contains actions for various accounts that are specific to their employee duties. 
System administrator duties includes create, remove, and manage accounts. Additionally, this employee can reset passwords.
Office manager duties includes examining parts, restocking parts, and using sales invoice to generate a sales commission.
Warehouse manager's duty include updating warehouse inventory.
Sales associate duties includes selling bike parts to clients and generating a sales invoice.


How is it set up?
If someone were to pick up our codebase today, they would get everything running in their local environment by downloading
all the correct files and placing them into the proper packages accordingly. They would then need to check if the code compiles
with no errors. If there are any errors, they could check where the problem is coming from and making sure that all the files
are under the same directory. They can then run the code and see how every part of the code functions. When the code has ran
everything in the code is implemented through the main. 

How is it used?
When the program is executed and starts running, a login screen will appear and prompt the user to enter in an employee's username and password of their login account. 
There are four different employees that will have login account information: system administrator, office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associate. 
Once the user enters the information for one of the employee on the login screen, the screen will open to the specific page for that employee with the actions and duties for that employee. 
If the user enters a login account information that does not exist, login screen will indicate to the user that the login account information given is not available.
Each employee page is divided by tabs in our program.
